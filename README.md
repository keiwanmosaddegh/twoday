# twoday

A new project, inspired by Matt D'avella's *The two day rule* video.

# So, what is The Two Day Rule?
It's very simple. Never skip the thing you're trying to accomplish two days in a row. It makes a lot of sense, because one missed day is really not a big deal. But a second makes it that much easier to miss a third day, a week, a month. At which point you don't really remember the activity at all.

# Okey nice. So how does the _twoday_ app work?
Just like that! I've developed a habit tracker, which tracks your activites, and changes color based on urgency.

A fresh, not yet executed on activity, begins uncolored. When ticking it off for the day, it turns green. The day later, yellow. Two days later, red.

When you've reached red, you've reached the endzone. It's do or die. If you don't manage to complete the activity today, then you'll lose your streak, and the habit will return to it's initial state - uncolored. We don't like uncolored. Let's keep it colored, shall we?
